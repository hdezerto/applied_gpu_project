# README — How to Run (Google Colab)

## 1) Open the notebook first (separately)
The notebook already contains the instructions to unzip the submission zip, so you should open the notebook directly in Colab (not by unzipping the zip in the Colab file browser first).

1. On your computer, open the submission `.zip` and extract only:
	- `Project_Notebook.ipynb`
2. Open Google Colab.
3. Go to **File → Open notebook → Upload** and upload `Project_Notebook.ipynb`.
4. Set **Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU**.

## 2) Upload the submission zip to Colab
The notebook expects the submission `.zip` to be uploaded to Colab as well.

- Upload `group14_code.zip` using the left sidebar **Files → Upload** in Colab.
- Then continue running the notebook cells (the notebook will unzip it and set the working directory automatically).

## 3) Follow the notebook instructions
From this point onward, follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook (downloading required files, compiling, running, and checking outputs).
